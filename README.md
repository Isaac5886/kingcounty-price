# üè° *Project Title:*  
# Advanced House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning


# üéØ *Objective:*  
To develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models that accurately predict house prices based on key features such as size, location, number of rooms, and construction year.

# üìÅ Dataset:
Utilize the King County House Sales dataset or any similar housing dataset with features like:

- `price` (target variable)  
- `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `sqft_living`, `sqft_lot`  
- `floors`, `waterfront`, `view`, `condition`  
- `sqft_above`, `sqft_basement`  
- `yr_built`, `yr_renovated`  
- Location features: `city`, `zipcode`  


# üîß Steps to Follow:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Convert `date` to useful time features  
   - Encode categorical variables (`zipcode`, `city`)  
   - Feature engineering (e.g., `house_age = 2025 - yr_built`)  
   - Scale/normalize features as needed  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Correlation matrix  
   - Price distribution  
   - Feature importance (e.g., `sqft_living` vs `price`)
- Location-based price variation (by city or zipcode)  

3. Model Training
   Train and compare multiple regression models:  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet  
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
   - Support Vector Regressor  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor  

4. Evaluation Metrics
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)  
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
   - R¬≤ Score  

5. Model Comparison 
   - Present results using tables or visualizations  
   - Discuss model strengths and weaknesses  

6. Model Optimization
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV)  
   - Apply k-fold cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold)  

7. Deployment
   - Build a simple Streamlit web app to deploy the best-performing model  
   - Allow users to input house features and get real-time price predictions
