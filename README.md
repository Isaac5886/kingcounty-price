# üè° Project Title:
# Advanced House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning


# üéØ Objective: 
To develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models that accurately predict house prices based on key features such as size, location, number of rooms, and construction year.

# üìÅ Dataset  

Utilize the *King County House Sales dataset* or any similar housing dataset with features like:

- `price` *(target variable)*  
- 'Date'
- `bedrooms`  
- `bathrooms`  
- `sqft_living`  
- `sqft_lot`  
- `floors`  
- `waterfront`  
- `view`  
- `condition`  
- `sqft_above`  
- `sqft_basement`  
- `yr_built`  
- `yr_renovated`  
- 'street'
- Location features: `city`, `zipcode`, 'country'

*Dataset Summary:*

- The dataset was sourced from *Kaggle*.  
- It contains *4,600 rows* and *18 columns*, each representing a house sale.  
- The data covers *King County*, USA, and includes both numerical and categorical features useful for regression modeling.  


# üîß Steps to Follow:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Convert `date` to useful time features  
   - Encode categorical variables 
   - Feature engineering  
   - Normalize features   

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Correlation matrix  
   - Price distribution  
   - Feature importance 
   - Location-based analysis

3. Model Training

    Train and compare the following models: 
   - Linear Regression  
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - ElasticNet  Regression 
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
   - Support Vector Regressor  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor  

5. Evaluation Metrics
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)  
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
   - R¬≤ Score  

6. Model Comparison 
   - Visual or tabular results Comparison 
   - strengths and weaknesses Discussion 

7. Model Optimization
   - GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
   - 5-fold cross-validation 

8. Deployment
   - Deploy best model with Streamlit 
   - create a user-friendly interface for Price Prediction inputs
